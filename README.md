If you’re going to exert mental effort/self-control (work on taxes, lower your calorie intake that day, etc), make sure you don’t exert mental effort/self-control on ANYTHING else. You have a limited reserve of mental effort/self-control and if you want to achieve one thing you have to let others slide.

Have a positive self-image. It’s no more wrong than a negative self-image and seriously boosts your mental health. 

Priming: If you are exposed to a thought, you are more likely to continue to think and act in line (more in association) with that thought. If made to act a certain way, you are more likely to think in line with that action. 

Quick Judgements (System 1) usually go for the choice that requires the least cognitive effort. Ex. When searching for a job, it is easier to get work from people who know you, even only slightly, because you seem familiar to their System 1 so System 2 doesn’t need to kick in as much.

“Biological reason for exposure = acceptance effect: To survive in a frequently dangerous world, an organism should react cautiously to a novel stimulus, with withdrawal and fear. Survival prospects are poor for an animal that is not suspicious of novelty. However, it is also adaptive for the initial caution to fade if the stimulus is actually safe. The mere exposure effect occurs, Zajonc claimed, because the repeated exposure of a stimulus is followed by nothing bad. Such a stimulus will eventually become a safety signal, and safety is good.

Therefore, the consequences of repeated exposures benefit the organism in its relations to the immediate animate and inanimate environment. They allow the organism to distinguish objects and habitats that are safe from those that are not, and they are the most primitive basis of social attachments. Therefore, they form the basis for social organization and cohesion—the basic sources of psychological and social stability.”

Hard question gets replaced by easy, related question whose answer then serves to create equivalent intensity answer for hard question.
Ex. HQ:How much money do I want to donate to save oily birds? => EQ: How mad am I about oily birds? => EQA: Really mad. => HQA: A large sum of money

Nunca dar consejo a nadie a menos que sepas exactamente de que estas hablando. 

The more you try to justify yourself, the more power you give others to judge you. 

People will do anything if they think they can get away with it.

What do i think i know and why do i think i know it?

Extreme outcomes are more likely in small sample sizes, and therefore don’t reflect reality as well.

System 1 is hard-wired to find patterns and cause-effect relationships, but often times just projects a pattern onto events that are simply random. 

Statistics produce many observations that appear to beg for causal explanations but do not lend themselves to such explanations. Many facts of the world are due to chance, including accidents of sampling. Causal explanations of chance events are inevitably wrong. 

System 1 understands sentences by trying to make them true, and the selective activation of compatible thoughts produces a family of systematic errors that make us gullible and prone to believe too strongly whatever we believe. 

“They instructed negotiators to focus their attention and search their memory for arguments against the anchor. The instruction to activate System 2 was successful. For example, the anchoring effect is reduced or eliminated when the second mover focuses his attention on the minimal offer that the opponent would accept, or on the costs to the opponent of failing to reach an agreement. In general, a strategy of deliberately “thinking the opposite” may be a good defense against anchoring effects, because it negates the biased recruitment of thoughts that produces these effects.”

The proof that you truly understand a pattern of behavior is that you know how to reverse it.

More you like something = less risky it seems / Less risky something seems = the more you like it

Anchor your judgment of the probability of an outcome on a plausible base rate. Ex. Even if a muslim man looks like a terrorist, recall that the majority of muslim men are not terrorists. 

Question the diagnosticity of your evidence: Plausible /= Probable

In terms of teaching: Compelling causal statistics will not change long-held beliefs or beliefs rooted in personal experience. On the other hand, surprising individual cases have a powerful impact and are a more effective tool for teaching psychology because the incongruity must be resolved and embedded in a causal story. 

People tend to inherently regress to a mean, we just create stories of cause and effect to satisfy our System 1. Ex. Golfer did great one day, will probably do worse the next, not because of nerves, but because of regression 

Intuitive predictions need to be corrected because they are not regressive and therefore are biased. Aim for a prediction that is intermediate between the baseline and your intuitive prediction. Ex. If average player scores 5 points and this time a player scored 10, next time expect them to score 7 or 8 points. (Depends on situation, if stocks are going up and you have excellent information that they will skyrocket very soon, make a prediction based on your information. Or if loss vs gain potential of you making an extreme prediction is skewed heavily toward gain, go with the extreme prediction).

The ultimate test of an explanation is whether it would have made the event predictable in advance.

You cannot help dealing with the limited information you have as if it were all there is to know. You build the best possible story from the information available to you, and if it is a good story, you believe it. Paradoxically, it is easier to construct a coherent story when you know little, when there are fewer pieces to fit into the puzzle. Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance. 

Because adherence to standard operating procedures is difficult to second-guess, decision makers who expect to have their decisions scrutinized with hindsight are driven to bureaucratic solutions—and to an extreme reluctance to take risks. As malpractice litigation became more common, physicians changed their procedures in multiple ways: ordered more tests, referred more cases to specialists, applied conventional treatments even when they were unlikely to help. These actions protected the physicians more than they benefited the patients, creating the potential for conflicts of interest. Increased accountability is a mixed blessing. 

Knowing the importance of luck, you should be particularly suspicious when highly consistent patterns emerge from the comparison of successful and less successful firms. In the presence of randomness, regular patterns can only be mirages. 

Refer the particular from the general, if the general is based on solid statistics.

Subjective confidence in a judgment is not a reasoned evaluation of the probability that this judgment is correct. Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it. It is wise to take admissions of uncertainty seriously, but declarations of high confidence mainly tell you that an individual has constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is true. 

Facts that challenge one’s basic assumptions—and thereby threaten people’s livelihood and self-esteem—are simply not absorbed. People have an incredible desire to be right and consider themselves good people.

We know that people can maintain an unshakable faith in any proposition, however absurd, when they are sustained by a community of like-minded believers.

Errors of prediction are inevitable because the world is unpredictable. High subjective confidence is not to be trusted as an indicator of accuracy (low confidence could be more informative). 

“Whenever we can replace human judgment by a formula, we should at least consider it.” 

“Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.”

How can we evaluate the probable validity of an intuitive judgment? When do judgments reflect true expertise? When do they display an illusion of validity? The answer comes from the two basic conditions for acquiring a skill: 
an environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable
an opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice 

intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment.

Short-term anticipation and long-term forecasting are different tasks, and the therapist has had adequate opportunity to learn one but not the other. 

The quicker and clearer the feedback, the faster a student learns in a regular, predictable environment

The planning fallacy describes plans and forecasts that are:

unrealistically close to best-case scenarios
could be improved by consulting the statistics of similar cases 

Optimism is highly valued, socially and in the market; people and firms reward the providers of dangerously misleading information more than they reward truth tellers.

I believe that someone who lacks a delusional sense of significance will wilt in the face of repeated experiences of multiple small failures and rare successes.

“She’s suing him for alimony. She would actually like to settle, but he prefers to go to court. That’s not surprising—she can only gain, so she’s risk averse. He, on the other hand, faces options that are all bad, so he’d rather take the risk.”

People become risk seeking when all their options are bad.

People are loss averse, chance of positive gain or the gain itself must be considerably greater in comparison to the potential loss for a content, comfortable person to gamble. This leads to a bias for the status quo. 

 “Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones.” They cite John Gottman, the well-known expert in marital relations, who observed that the long-term success of a relationship depends far more on avoiding the negative than on seeking the positive. Gottman estimated that a stable relationship requires that good interactions outnumber bad interactions by at least 5 to 1. Other asymmetries in the social domain are even more striking. We all know that a friendship that may take years to develop can be ruined by a single action.

Because negotiators are influenced by a norm of reciprocity, a concession that is presented as painful calls for an equally painful (and perhaps equally inauthentic) concession from the other side.

The basic principle in the public perception of fairness is that the existing wage, price, or rent sets a reference point, which has the nature of an entitlement that must not be infringed.
Ex. If you pay my $9/hr and then one day lower my wage to $7/hr, I will find this unfair, regardless of the company’s economic situation. 
If I pay $300 for a PS4 and then learn that a week later the store I purchased from has lowered PS4 prices to $200, I will find this unfair (and be less likely to purchase from that store again).

When you pay attention to a hypothetical, far-in-the-future threat, you worry. The worry is rarely proportional to the probability of the threat. (Immediate threats, such as physical violence, deserve full attention).

People who face very bad options take desperate gambles, accepting a high probability of making things worse in exchange for a small hope of avoiding a large loss. Risk taking of this kind often turns manageable failures into disasters. The thought of accepting the large sure loss is too painful, and the hope of complete relief too enticing, to make the sensible decision that it is time to cut one’s losses.

How people react to very low or very high probability gambles 

Emotion and vividness influence fluency, availability, and judgments of probability—and thus account for our excessive response to low probability situations.
Conclusion: Emotions are irrational, use statistics to make decisions instead.

The format in which risks are presented affects the emotional response. Ex. The idea of denominator neglect helps explain why different ways of communicating risks vary so much in their effects. You read that “a vaccine that protects children from a fatal disease carries a 0.001% risk of permanent disability.” The risk appears small. Now consider another description of the same risk: “One of 100,000 vaccinated children will be permanently disabled.” The second statement does something to your mind that the first does not: it calls up the image of an individual child who is permanently disabled by a vaccine; the 999,999 safely vaccinated children have faded into the background. As predicted by denominator neglect, low-probability events are much more heavily weighted when described in terms of relative frequencies (how many) than when stated in more abstract terms of “chances,” “risk,” or “probability” (how likely). 

We have neither the inclination nor the mental resources to enforce consistency on our preferences, and our preferences are not magically set to be coherent. 

A sermon for loss aversion on bets where chances for gain or loss are equal but potential gain is greater than potential loss:
I sympathize with your aversion to losing any gamble, but it is costing you a lot of money. Please consider this question: Are you on your deathbed? Is this the last offer of a small favorable gamble that you will ever consider? Of course, you are unlikely to be offered exactly this gamble again, but you will have many opportunities to consider attractive gambles with stakes that are very small relative to your wealth. You will do yourself a large financial favor if you are able to see each of these gambles as part of a bundle of small gambles and rehearse the mantra that will get you significantly closer to economic rationality: you win a few, you lose a few. The main purpose of the mantra is to control your emotional response when you do lose. If you can trust it to be effective, you should remind yourself of it when deciding whether or not to accept a small risk with positive expected value. 

Remember these qualifications when using the mantra: 
It works when the gambles are genuinely independent of each other; it does not apply to multiple investments in the same industry, which would all go bad together. 
It works only when the possible loss does not cause you to worry about your total wealth. If you would take the loss as significant bad news about your economic future, watch it!
It should not be applied to long shots, where the probability of winning is very small for each bet.

 If you have the emotional discipline that this rule requires, you will never consider a small gamble in isolation or be loss averse for a small gamble until you are actually on your deathbed —and not even then. 

Adding a bunch of small bets together and considering them together is called broad framing, and is important to overcoming loss aversion. You win a few, you lose a few, but if the gambles in the bundle you take are in your favor, odds are you’ll come out with a positive gain.

In addition to improving the emotional quality of life, the deliberate avoidance of exposure to short-term outcomes improves the quality of both decisions and outcomes.

“The decision to invest additional resources in a losing account, when better investments are available, is known as the sunk-cost fallacy. It keeps people for too long in poor jobs, unhappy marriages, and unpromising research projects. I have often observed young scientists struggling to salvage a doomed project when they would be better advised to drop it and start a new one.”

What makes people lose-averse is the fear of regret. Go with statistical probabilities, not fear of failure. 

Rationality is generally served by broader and more comprehensive frames (of reference), and joint evaluation is obviously broader than single evaluation. Of course, you should be wary of joint evaluation when someone who controls what you see has a vested interest in what you choose.

Your moral feelings are attached to frames, to descriptions of reality rather than to reality itself.

Sunk costs should be ignored. History is irrelevant and the only issue that matters is the set of options you have now, and their likely consequences.

“Let’s reframe the problem by changing the reference point. Imagine we did not own it; how much would we think it is worth?”

The first and foremost thing which any ordinary (comfortable enough) person does is nothing.

"You could call it heroic responsibility, maybe. Not like the usual sort. It means that whatever happens, no matter what, it's always your fault. Even if you tell the teacher, call the cops, they’re not responsible for what happens, you are. Following the rules isn't an excuse, someone else being in charge isn't an excuse, even trying your best isn't an excuse. There just aren't any excuses, you've got to get the job done no matter what.”

The lesson, it seemed, was that things had to be incredibly close by before your brain could comprehend them well enough to feel fear.

the point of a subjective Bayesian calculation wasn't that, after you made up a bunch of numbers, multiplying them out would give you an exactly right answer. The real point was that the process of making up numbers would force you to tally all the relevant facts and weigh all the relative probabilities.

Critch's theories about hedonics: small immediate positive and negative feedbacks secretly control most of what we actually do

The trick of doing the impossible is being selective about which impossibilities you challenge, and only trying when you have a special advantage.

When you do a fault analysis, there's no point in assigning fault to a part of the system you can't change afterward, it's like stepping off a cliff and blaming gravity. Gravity isn't going to change next time. There's no point in trying to allocate responsibility to people who aren't going to alter their actions. Once you look at it from that perspective, you realize that allocating blame never helps anything unless you blame yourself, because you're the only one whose actions you can change by putting blame there. 

Normal people don't choose on the basis of consequences, they just play roles. the little picture of themselves they have in their head can't learn from experience or change themselves, so there isn't any point in trying to persuade them to change. People like this aren't responsible for anything, people like us are, and when we fail there's no one else to blame."

Indifference is deadlier than hate, and far, far more common.

There is only one reality that generates all of the observations. If different observations seem to point in incompatible directions, it means the true hypothesis is one you haven't thought of yet.

It is only by harsh experience that we learn which principles take priority over which other principles; as mere words they all sound equally persuasive.
It makes sense for the mortals not to care about their world's end; why should they, when they are just going to die regardless, and can save themselves the inconvenience of trying to do anything difficult along the way?
You can only arrive at mastery by practicing the techniques you have learned, facing challenges and apprehending them, using to the fullest the tools you have been taught, until they shatter in your hands and you are left in the midst of wreckage absolute... I cannot create masters. I have never known how to create masters. Go, then, and fail... You have been shaped into something that may emerge from the wreckage, determined to remake your Art. I cannot create masters, but if you had not been taught, your chances would be less. The higher road begins after the Art seems to fail you; though the reality will be that it was you who failed your Art.
People will often do something painful and boring, like hiking or visiting Europe, entirely for the sake of making the experience part of their ongoing life’s narrative. They will remember it as something significant and meaningful, even though the process of actually doing it was dull and/or pointlessly strenuous. (This explains all of my parents’ vacations) 

Helen was happy if she spent most of her time engaged in activities that she would rather continue than stop, little time in situations she wished to escape, and—very important because life is short—not too much time in a neutral state in which she would not care either way. 

“The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing? Forget how these things might look in a narrative, and just do them for the pleasure of the experience itself, not the memory of the experience.” 

The goals that people set for themselves are so important to what they do and how they feel about it that an exclusive focus on experienced well-being is not tenable. We cannot hold a concept of well-being that ignores what people want. On the other hand, it is also true that a concept of well-being that ignores how people feel as they live and focuses only on how they feel when they think about their life is also untenable. We must accept the complexities of a hybrid view, in which the well-being of both selves is considered.

Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it. 

Depression involves a self-reinforcing cycle of miserable thoughts.

The focusing illusion creates a bias in favor of goods and experiences that are initially exciting, even if they will eventually lose their appeal. Time is neglected, causing experiences that will retain their attention value in the long term to be appreciated less than they deserve to be. 

It is logical to describe the life of the experiencing self as a series of moments, each with a value. The value of an episode—I have called it a hedonimeter total—is simply the sum of the values of  its moments. But this is not how the mind represents episodes. The remembering self, as I have described it, also tells stories and makes choices, and neither the stories nor the choices properly represent time. In storytelling mode, an episode is represented by a few critical moments, especially the beginning, the peak, and the end. Duration is neglected. 

The neglect of duration combined with the peak end rule causes a bias that favors a short period of intense joy over a long period of moderate happiness.

Freedom has a cost, which is borne by individuals who make bad choices, and by a society that feels obligated to help them.

Fear is the great inner enemy, and must be attacked and destroyed wherever you find it in yourself.
